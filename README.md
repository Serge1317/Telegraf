# Telegraf 
## A simple messanger uses Firebase.
To run the project you need to clone the repository, create a new project in Firebase, 
get google-services.json (Project settings -> General -> click the "google-services.json").
Once the google-services.json is downloaded - place it into your "app" folder.
